# Data Science Lehigh Repo

## Club Description
### ––– Mission Statement –––
In the last ten years, data science has become an integral part of business. Technology companies harness proprietary data sets to tailor user experiences, construct strategic decisions, and create competitive advantages. High-performing hedge funds invest millions of dollars into trained professionals who scrape web traffic, funnel their collections into a targeted form, and then assemble financial models. Manufactures inject thousands of devices throughout their factories to track production progress, evaluate defect statistics, and identify bottlenecks more clearly. However, until recently, collecting, accessing, and analyzing data as a member of the public for career advancement, content creation, or personal enjoyment had been an overwhelming process bogged down by limited data sets, restrictive modeling techniques, and a lack of educational resources. Today, every individual with a computer, access to the internet, and a willingness to learn can tap into the potential of data science and unlock information never available before. This club focuses on two aspects: (1) empowering individuals with the tools to explore their interests through data science and (2) providing the university community with a group of trained students to help complete data-intensive tasks. We want to help individuals develop an extremely useful skill after graduation and have fun doing it.

### ––– Structure –––
The club will have a team-oriented and flexible structure, run by discrete sets of individuals working together through a common interest rather than a powerful executive board. The breakdown of membership and the types of projects envisioned are described below, from entry to advanced members:

#### Entry Level

True Data Science Track

1.	Follow a crash course on computer science if not familiar with the fundamentals; resources for learning and the steps to become proficient in basic computer science will be provided in a Readme on github
2.	If already familiar with computer science fundamentals, skip step 1 and learn python through example problems, in-depth File I/O learning modules, and other resources posted on the website
3.	Learn data science with python, utilizing the extensive libraries that simplify the process of filtering and presenting graphs

Business Analytics Only Track

1.	Learn tableau and advanced excel features
2.	Learn how to pull in data from an SQL database through a GUI application or import massive data sets created/found by other team members

The rest is taught through project experience overtime and how much extra effort the individual wants to put into their tasks. From financial modeling to training scientific data sets to predict a future outcome, there are a number of advanced topics that individuals will be able to learn through their own will-power and university resources. There will be a ton of information posted in a well-formatted file base with extensive documentation to help individuals tackle problems, and this file base will be updated as the club progresses.

#### Member Level

1.	Join an area that interests you, or create a new area of research that interests you
2.	Begin working in a team, learning skills as you progress through projects 
3.	After finishing a project, members of the team must create a report and give a thorough presentation to the club for feedback. The type of presentation depends on the domain of the problem, but will typically involve a normal case study, scientific analysis, or financial modeling format. The report will be posted on the website for student recognition and additional learning resources.
 
The most important part comes at the end, where members of the group are expected to ask questions which will lead the team to the following types of questions:
If you want to continue the current project, what does the data and your analysis mean for the next step in researching? How can the group use the techniques from this project in the future?

#### Executive Level

1.	The executive team is a very small group of individuals that deal with the management level of the club. Their only jobs include interacting with the school and companies, recruiting fellow Lehigh students and handling acceptance into the club, scheduling events for the club, and any other trivial tasks. The core focus of this club is not on an executive position. The executives’ main goal is to provide more resources for members and help provide better content for teams.


### ––– Projects –––
The success of the club relies on two components: a hardworking set of teams and valuable content. And in order for team members to enjoy their work–the primary goal of the club–they need valuable content. The data sets will come from any of the following places: (1) a number of open source datasets online that are posted for members to find themselves when a new project arises, (2) collected by members themselves when the group becomes advanced enough (3) faculty from Lehigh that either need help in analyzing data from a study or want students to handle their data analysis. The university is an engineering school at the core, hopefully the club can take advantage of the data-centric, scientific research happening throughout campus.

The projects will be determined or accepted by members in teams that want to pursue the topic. There’s no limit, other than that it has to be appropriate and follow the code of conduct. From public transportation, sports, law, and mechanical engineering, to econometrics, agriculture, and operating system performance, the domains of research are determined by the members and the amount of data available.


## New Members
### –––Onboarding to the Team–––

### Data Science Track
#### Intro
If you’re not already familiar with computer science, the club will train you to a level where you are comfortable with the fundamentals. Learning computer science boils down to being resourceful, practicing A LOT, and not being afraid to ask questions. Get good at looking up technical topics on your own, there’s a ton of communities online ready to answer your questions through a simple google search.

#### Course
The best way to learn computer science is to take the introductory programming class at Lehigh. But for business students that just want to complete simple SQL queries, filter data, and create graphs, a full-fledged course isn’t necessary as most of what you’ll learn anyways will be through experience.

Therefore, if you’d rather not take a computer science course, and you are motivated enough to learn topics on your own time, we suggest completing a 7-day trial on the learn python course at https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python. This is definitely not the best course to learn computer science, so if you find another one go ahead and try that one. However, most of the people that have gone through this onboarding process have preferred the platform as it’s not very time-consuming. Try your best to complete most of the course in a week, we do not want you to pay for the subscription if you don’t finish in time as it’s not worth it. 

#### Primer
While you’re taking a course, you have to get setup with a good development environment. Download python from the website. Then, download a text editor or IDE. We suggest downloading the text editor Atom and installing the following packages:

Hydrogen, atom-beautify, atom-clock
atom-ide. atom-ide-debugger-python, atom-ide-ui
file-icons, highlight-selected, ide-json
minimap, minimap-highlight-selected, autocomplete-python
python-tools, python-indent

Learn how to run a script for now with the GUI, the command line will become handy after some experience.

#### More Python Resources for Future
Once you’ve run out of time, have completed a course, or already know computer science and just want to learn more about Python, use https://www.learnpython.org/ and https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python3/index.htm as references for syntax and fundamental computer science ideas. 

#### Assignemnts
There are five assignments we want entry members on the data science track to complete to test their skills. The five assignments can be found in the Assignments folder. Once these assignments are completed correctly, a member of the team will review your code and provide you feedback. If the programs meet the expectations of the reviewer, congratulations you’ve finished our onboarding process, learned Python, and are familiar with the fundamentals of computer science. If you want to get even better at computer science, we have provided more practice problems and ideas under the Learn More folder. We want the members to continue to add resources under this folder, so if you learn something not already in the folder on your own, please type up a summary. We ask the summary has a tutorial and/or a link to the resource used, and that you share it with someone on the executive committee so that we can push it to the database for other members. This club is driven by the collective learning and experiences of the members, and will continue to grow through you!

#### Joining a team
Now that you’ve finished learning Python, it’s time to start getting into data science. Join one of the teams working in a discipline that interests you. If there aren’t any, create your own project and we’ll help provide the resources to get you started. If you’re creating a new project, look below for resources on where/how to find a good data set. From here on out, use the resources found in the GitHub, online communities, other team members, and your own will power to power your learning experience. The success of the club relies on two components: a hardworking set of teams and valuable content. Help bring both to the table and everyone will have a more enjoyable time in their projects!
